The goal of this paper was to fill in the mathematical gaps in this paper on the same topic: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/3/766/htm

This paper lays out the basic framework for the network but does not provide enough detail on the inner workings of the network to independently build one.
Using this paper and general knowledge of machine learning, I did my best to recreate their network in NumPy. I decided to use NumPy because while it is 
certainly not the most practical package to build complicated neural nets with, the goal of this project was to explore the maths rather then end 
up with a working prototype. For this purpose, NumPy was an excellent choice becasue of it's intuitive matrix/tensor operations.
